Hi, this is He Yang. Or call me kernel.bin, one of my nickname. [![Codeforces Rating](https://cfrating.ihcr.top/?user=kernel.bin&style=flat-square)](https://codeforces.com/profile/kernel.bin)

I'm a college student, Chinese. I'm a Win32 Developer. (also interested in algorithms & Information Security, I have a plan to participate ACM or CTF). Now I major in computer science.

I used to write some fun bot projects for OIer, and I contribute to [ReactOS](https://github.com/reactos/reactos). I'm also working on some other interesting projects.
I like to play games as well. Minecraft, Genshin Impact and Arknights are the games I often play.
